# Hotel Bookings Cancel Classifier: Project Overview
* The model predicts whether the client will cancel booking or not with accuracy of 85.91%. I did this project to learn about classification problems and it may help hotels to check whether their client cancels the booking or not.
* Get data from Kaggle.com datasets [Hotel booking demand](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
* Cleaned Data (Handled missing values).
* Perform exploratory data analysis to know about data.
* Perform feature engineering.
* Built model and optimize it.
* Built client facing API using flask.
